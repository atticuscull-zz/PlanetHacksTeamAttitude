A map of populated areas and places to go


## Population Heatmap

On the front-end,

- A website using the google maps API to show a heatmap of populated areas
- You can use the Calculate Route button to give you a destination that is not populated


On the back-end,

- We are using Node.js to store location data
- All locations are completely anonymous and store no personal data
